notes for michelle:
 - download new csv for all bee interactions
 - first try the cleaning workflow that the capstone students put together to get the bees into source and the plants into target
 - the cleaned data can be used to then figure out the issue with the institution codes
 - then you can start going back into the plant lists and try Taxonstand with the updated list
 - keep a list of the plants that don’t make the TPL
 - check for the plants that don’t merge between SCI and globe dataset

new institution code list

how do we want to handle records from the same institution (e.g. arachnid collection versus moth collection)?
how do we want to handle records from the same program, but housed in different collections?
# Seems like grouping under most basic institution makes the most sense
# group by institution -- big umbrellas
M: will continue small edits and let everyone know when
M: make all variations in institution codes listed

K: what dataset are we currently working with?
G: working with a file from Nov 2020
K: continue working with Nov 2020 and then update once code etc looks good
G: added Nov csv to the google drive "all_bee_interactions_unique"

G: synonyms
split apart columns, removed authors, removed subspecies
without synonyms matched 29,000 records
with synonyms matched 31,000 records
number of species doesn't change
convert globi names to just current names
K: are you doing a search on names just from SCI?
if there's a match, add it to current name
what was the big dataset
how many got trimmed from all available data
based on all globi dataset

bee checklist from sci == genus_species (full species name)
K: remove species that include "sp." epithat
plant.list == genus_species (full species name)

step 4: subsetted to anything with "Plantae" record
3035 unique bees and plant species

step 5: bee synonym data
K: some synonyms may have the parentheses in the globi dataset



THOUGHTS FROM ME:
+ add PlantStandTaxon column to plant list before it goes into Grace's checklist format workflow



used "matched_rows csv" from Data file from the checklist formatting workflow
started with 5586
1441 did not merge ~=97 unique plants
these could just be species that aren't on SCI, but check with Grace about the checklist workflow
maybe walk through format_dat_checklist for reference

K: discover life name list
bees in taxize package
zenodo
https://zenodo.org/record/5738043#.YafHGpDMJTY

M: what to do with interactions that only have genus for plant name
could be tricky 
has to be at species

- look at data for full species
- do analysis at genus level
- run script
- output file (make really clear for other workflows

*send Katja list of SourceCodes that need matching with instituions

G: bee synonym list
pull out synonyms from GloBI database

Y&K: continue using discover life checklists for bees


=================
Meeting 13-Oct-21
=================

Institutions not listed:
BBSLID
KWC
HOLO
LACMENT
PUB


rare case where institution ID is different between source and target
aren't separate specimen

sourceTaxonId -- identifier for that specific name
sourceCatalogNumber --



keep plant names at species level


# to do
send Katja list of specimen missing sourceCatalogNumber
Everything after reference citation (including reference citation)



=================
Meeting 29-Sep-21
=================

# Yolanda worked on spreadsheet of names for bees
map of bee synonyms

# Updating plant names
taxonstand
taxize
good documentation and more transparent than a package that could be re-published
* make synonym list

# Missing bee names
either hyper-rare, new etc
just discuss and take out of the dataset
* Katja will send updated list

# phenology
Grace -- are bees that are around year-round more generalist?
Katja -- or are bees that are around year-round specialists on asters?

# fuzzy name matching using the synonym
how to integrate these packages into scripts

# difference between source and reference
where data was compiled
up to 8 citations
Symbiota collection of arthropods
need to look for institution codes for all specimen data
use collection/source as covariate

# how to deal with the phenology
rows as bees
columns as plants
different sheets as different months
each bee and plant can interact
different piles of those sheets depending on the citation
collector might not be there
occurence data unique on collectors names for SCI

how to get rid of sheets
vectorize in order to make the computation easier

# phenology zeros versus NAs for plant data versus bee data



to do:
plant phenology list: change NAs to ZEROs!!!!
institutions: work on list of codes for LARGER GEOGRAPHY
fuzzy name matching for plants taxonstand or taxize



=================
Meeting 14-Sep-21

Erickson and Smith 2021

paper questions:
i like the use of collector covariates
how many records do not have collector information?
do we think something like detection history could be helpful?
dates and names associated with each visit
grouping dates together based on research trips
each kind of researcher has their own detection probability

highest predictive accuracy full model
including covariates improved accuracy more than filtering the data
probably due to the high volume of community scientists with singleton observations

big differences in collections by community scientists versus experts

at least two independent visits per site

Using normal occupancy model: only two parts
Varied: covariates and data filtering
Guzman uses multi-species occupancy model: Saroye paper should have been more careful with filtering
geography and visits (used metadata -- and infer zeros)
Lucky if you know other kinds of metadata

ASSUMPTIONS:
will come up naturally with looking at the model




our data filtering:
 - geographically SCI
 - collector or author can be the same
 	- K: collector names will be messy; can use name filtering; will need to be cleaned
 - repeated indices mostly cleaned; can check using catalogue number; insects less likely
 - don't need to filter for data that does not have an associated date

 
 
Plant traits:
 - M: add calflora dates for phenology
 - M: email draft of floral traits to Grace
 


BEE SPECIES/PLANT SPECIES/COLLECTOR
some spaces will be blocked out
what proportion will be blocked out?
what proportion will be already excluded from our dataset?

K: looking at Apis mellifera removal
to better understand species disappearance







=================
Meeting 19-Aug-21
=================

Phenology of bees and plants
 - phenology as a covariate or some sort of limit in the analysis
 - potential for bees and plants to not be in the same space
 - use phenology as a filter to limit the plant list based on full range of bees
 - how distinct are these time periods
*****
 - various ways of collecting phenology data based on geographic-based occurrence data or literature search

Guzman and Soroye:
 - restrictions of space and time
 - how did they decide on the places to limit
 - simulate data and build in restrictions and then without the restrictions in the analysis

Phenology and geography
 - how do you limit the geography that you’re taking into account?
 - maybe compare the limits: all the data or limited filtered data based on eco-zone
 - expanded limitation (insects can fly)


Simulated data
 - many decisions to be made about the data generating process and the models to be used
 - you can ask: how does my model hold up to violations of assumptions?


Model covariate choice:
 - number of covariates (simplicity versus complete/complex)
 —> depends on sample size


Ecological model — what do we think influences the bee decision
 - size (bigger bees can fly to more species, more generalist?)



Detection model - what is limiting observability
 - size (bigger bees detected more often)


Visitation model - observations done



*****
Next steps:
 - restricted occupancy models
 - not allowing every plant-pollinator interaction to occur

MICHELLE:
 - look into papers that allow for choice or no interactions
 - flower traits lists
 - re-read Guzman and Soroye papers








============
Meeting June
============
Ultimate question:

The GloBI database:
 - what is the difference in interaction detection using Globi data
 
What can we learn about the biological traits:
 - what biological traits are associated with more interactions?
 - do social bees visit more plants than eusocial?
 - what sampling biases are we facing?
 
What can we learn about the plants:
 - what are the keystone plants that are sustaining bee diversity?
 
Data quality:
 - what holes are left in our biological thinking
 - which bees still lack data?
 - is there enough data to do space and time analyses?
 




Plant list:
 - SBBG will give plant list and filter for flowering species
 - potential issue: plants that do not match might need to be updated



 
Assumptions:
 - time is not something that we'll think about
 




Third dimension: Citations
 - scale of aggregating citations (source citation)
 - rather than individual IDs
 - number of unique collectors contributing to each source citation

 

 

Biological covariates:
 - Bartomeus paper
 - Michelle will look at "forbidden links" -- what goes into these data?
 	- phenology
 	- physiology
 - Michelle flower color/size/type
 - thermal range

 





Detection covariate:
 - like Robin Thorpe as a covariate (what is the impact of one person on a collection)
 - Katja will identify very good taxonomists (confidence scale)
 - looking at number of collectors: what do they predominantly collect?
 - relationship between collector and rare/common bee collection
 
 - seasonality (more detectible in the spring than in the summer)
 - verbatim event date -- should be scaled
 
 - weather (yearly temp and precipitation)
 - take weather and bin for each aggregation (into each season)


 
 

Unique covariate sets for both the biological and detection covariates:
- flower size/shape
- bee physiology






1-June-2021

Yolanda’s research:
 - will continue to use other papers and resources
 - will likely have size and sociality ready by August
 - will highlight for areas of questions/concerns


Michelle’s research:
 - will put together similar work to Yolanda’s for flowers
 - phenology
 - flower shape/size/color







Assumptions related to Soroye paper:
 - cut-offs to include a bee species (minimum citation count)
 - divided each intervals
 - Grace: can we assume that citations are separate replicate datasets? Repeated surveys? Simulate dataset 
 - Katja: major pulses of surveys (Robin Thorpe ’05, ’96, arthropod surveys of California, UCSB surveys ’19, ’21), look at clustered collection times/dates and relate to known surveys
 - proportion of literature/inaturalist
 - try surveys as another way estimate repeated surveys
 - comparing output from multiple ways of data aggregation (where data is not always included in these larger databases like GloBI versus )





Single species versus multiple-species (Soroye versus Guzman papers):
- all of the species datasets run independently, no info is shared
- multi-species info is shared: assume parameters estimated for all species come from the same distribution
- species x and y are not so independent — have common origins and characteristics, they will be more similar to one another rather than independent
- stronger information to rare species
- single species — not perpetuating uncertainties
